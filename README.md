# The BTTN

The BTTN is a giant “HELP” button that you can press whenever software tools are in your way instead of being helpful. 

## How to use it

1. Press the button
2. Describe your problem
3. Get back to work 

## Examples 

- “I’m googling my bank account website several times a month, I should research a better way to handle my bookmarks.”
- “Maybe I should add this programm to auto-run on each startup, I wonder how i do that. But I shouldn’t do it right now, I’m in the middle of something urgent”
- “I’m repeating these steps over and over, maybe my colleague can help me automate it.”

## Benefits

- Get help - from your colleagues, the community or Artificial Intelligence
- Avoid the distraction - Make a note instead of distracting yourself by acting right now
- Don’t forget about it - allow yourself to prioritze it later

Click Killer provides a fast way to get the nuisance out of your head and sidesteps the dillema of acting either “now” or “never”.

# Background

I want to build a software tool that is useful to the productivity crowd think management consultants, software developers, product owner etc. People who would also enjoy ProductHunt. Keyboard shortcuts and so on.

At the moment it's a bit hard to describe what the tool will do.

Therefore I want to have an exagerated play on this "omnious" button. 

For example
- Landing Page: Don't ask what the button can do, ask what it can not do.
- Offer a physical buzzer button with USB for $99 (nobody needs to buy it but it adds to the "over the top" comic appeal)

- Visually it can be a bit "in your face" not too serious too


Can you expand this concept and add some ideas?

Goals:

1. I use it and I find it useful
2. I have 1 new user per week
3. I do more interviews


What are my ideal users? PowerUsers = demanding
Less frequent = less demanding, less use?

WHY? 
> creates a dialog, a stream of annoyances
> it's a basis from where i can offer more things / experiment
> I can sollicit feedack
