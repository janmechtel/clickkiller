# The Clickkiller BTTN

The BTTN is a giant “HELP” buzzer for whenever software tools are in your way instead of being helpful. 

## How to use it

1. Press the button
2. Take some notes 
3. Get back to work 

## Examples

- “I’m googling my bank account website several times a month, I should research a better way to handle my bookmarks.”
- “Maybe I should add this programm to auto-run on each startup, I wonder how i do that. But I shouldn’t do it right now, I’m in the middle of something urgent”
- “I’m repeating these steps over and over, maybe my colleague can help me automate it.”

## Benefits

- Avoid the distraction - Make a note instead of distracting yourself by acting right now
- Don’t forget about it - allow yourself to prioritze it later
- Get help - from your colleagues, the community or Artificial Intelligence

The BTTN provides a fast way to get the nuisance out of your head and sidesteps the dillema of acting either “now” or “never”.
